 查看sql server中执行的语句的情况的脚本，可与排查性能，死锁问题
```SQL
SELECT DISTINCT r.scheduler_id,
                r.status,
                r.session_id AS SPID,

                sp.program_name AS ProgramName,
                COALESCE(sp.LOGINAME, sp.nt_username) AS HostName,

                DATEDIFF(minute, r.start_time, GETDATE()) AS Duration,
